DeepWebCash 4.1.1
=============

Reborn
--------------
DeepWebCash was reset at Dec. 2018.


What is DeepWebCash?
--------------

[DeepWebCash](https://dw.cash/) is an implementation of the "Zerocash" protocol.
Based on Bitcoin's code, it intends to offer a far higher standard of privacy
through a sophisticated zero-knowledge proving scheme that preserves
confidentiality of transaction metadata. Technical details are available
in our [Protocol Specification](https://github.com/deepwebcash/zips/raw/master/protocol/protocol.pdf).


This software is the DeepWebCash client. It downloads and stores the entire history
of DeepWebCash transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network
connection, the synchronization process could take a day or more once the
blockchain has reached a significant size.

Security Warnings
